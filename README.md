# Artificial Intelligence Course Repo (CS 480)
This repository is dedicated to tracking the progress of my Artificial Intelligence (AI) course, providing notes, code, and other resources as the class progresses. Below is an outline of the course goals, topics covered, and evaluation methods.

## Course Goals
The primary objective of this course is to explore and develop programming methods or tools for performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks range from understanding natural language and strategic game playing to image processing and speech recognition. We will explore a variety of AI techniques, including symbolic and logical frameworks, combinatorial optimization, statistical approaches, and neural network models.

### Focus Areas

1. **Combinatorial Search**
   - Modeling problem-solving as a graph search
   - Techniques to find optimal paths
   - Strategies for multiplayer games with uncertainty, randomness, and incomplete information

2. **Statistical Modeling**
   - Capturing environmental uncertainty
   - Applying models to games with randomness and incomplete information

3. **Neural Networks**
   - Simple perceptron models to deep neural networks
   - Training networks with back-propagation
   - Implementing convolutional neural networks

4. **Machine Learning**
   - Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms
   - Applications in game playing, handwriting recognition, document classification, etc.

5. **Applications**
   - Real-world applications like game playing, handwriting recognition, audio content recognition, and more
