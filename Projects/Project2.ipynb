        "## Overview\n",
        "In this project, I will implement the search algorithms—Breadth-First Search (BFS),  Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and A* search algorithm - to solve the *sorting by reversal* problem. This problem has practical applications in computational molecular biology, specifically in assessing gene sequence similarities, as described in the book *Computational Molecular Biology: An Algorithmic Approach* by Pavel A. Pevzner.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Problem Statement\n",
        "The starting state of the problem is an arbitrary permutation, π, of numbers `[1, 2, …, n]`, while the goal state is the sorted sequence `[1, 2, …, n]`. To transition from the starting state to the goal state, one must select a contiguous block within the permutation and reverse it. The objective is to sort the permutation in the fewest number of reversals.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "Given the permutation `[1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5]`, reversing the block `[4, 2, 6]` results in the permutation `[1, 3, 6, 2, 4, 5]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Project Requirements\n",
        "The following algorithms will be implemented:\n",
        "1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n",
        "2. **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**\n",
        "3. **A* Search** using an admissible heuristic `h` (described below).\n",
        "\n",
        "These implementations will use a tree-search approach, avoiding only trivial cycles of length 2. This means that for each node, all successors, except the parent node, are added to the fringe, regardless of whether they are already in or have been removed from the fringe.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Heuristic Function for A* Search\n",
        "In the A* search implementation, we use a heuristic function `h` defined as follows:\n",
        "- For a given permutation π = `[x1, x2, …, xn]`, a break-point `j` is an integer such that `1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1` and `xj` and `xj+1` are not consecutive integers.\n",
        "- **Example:** The permutation `[5, 4, 6, 1, 2, 7, 3]` has four break-points.\n",
        "- The heuristic function `h(π) = 1/2 ×` the number of break-points.\n",
        "- A binary heap is used to implement the fringe (Open set) for A* search.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Program Execution\n",
        "When the program is executed, it will prompt the user to enter a permutation `P` (e.g., `3 4 5 1 8 6 2 7`). The output will include:\n",
        "- The sequence of states, from the initial permutation to the sorted sequence, found by BFS and A* search, with one state per line.\n",
        "- The total CPU time used by each algorithm.\n",
        "- The total number of nodes added to the queue.\n",
        "- The maximum size of the queue during the search process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tree-search version eliminates the need to maintain both OPEN and CLOSED sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Constraints and Testing\n",
        "The program will be tested on input sizes up to `n ≤ 10`.\n",
